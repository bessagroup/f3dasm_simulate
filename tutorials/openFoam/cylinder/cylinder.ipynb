    "This tutorial is directly inspired from the flow around a cylinder case discribed [here](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/tutorial-guide/2-incompressible-flow/2.2-flow-around-a-cylinder) and whose geoemetry is reported below.\n",

    "In this tutorial, the input velocity, output pressure and mesh size are automatically drawn from a design of experiemt generated with F3DASM. The reulting error with respect to the analytical solution is extracted and stored.\n",

    "> **_NOTE:_**  This tutorial was tested with openfoam10. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://openfoam.org/version/10/). However, it should be compatible with the both main OpenFoam releases, from OpenCFD Ltd. and OpenFoam Foundation. Please report any issues using the Github issue interface.\n"
